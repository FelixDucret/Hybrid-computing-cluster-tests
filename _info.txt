Boost configuration:

To compile boost program using the library Boost.program_options,
first download the boost library and follow the steps indicated on
this page : 
https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_69_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html
(you may replace the 1_69_0 if you have another version of the boost 
library)

You have to edit the makefile to make it work. The syntax of the makefile for
the program options library is:

all:
	c++ -I "path to the boost_1_69_0 unzipped file" test.cpp -o test \
	-L"path to your library files (.so or .a, check your /usr/include or
	/usr/lib files)" -lboost_program_options-mt
